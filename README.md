 AI without UX is of limited utility. UX is what distributes that intelligence across the organization and pushes it to the edge – where it can be consumed by practitioners and subject matter experts.  Ultimately, the process of operationalizing an intelligent application within the enterprise requires some change in the organization, an acceptance that the application will evolve over time, and that it will demand downstream changes – automated or otherwise.  For this to happen, intelligent applications need to be “live” in the business process, seeing new data and automatically executing the loop of discover, predict, justify on a frequency that makes sense for that business process. For some processes, that may be quarterly, for others, daily. That loop can even be measured in seconds.
